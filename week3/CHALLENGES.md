### 1. Split class into its own files (.h and .cpp)
- include them in the main cpp 
- create 2 objects, class example phone and object of your own choice
### 2. Add new features to phone class
- add method called ChargeBattery(int charge) 
- increases battery by charge amount (dont let it go over 100%)
### 3. Simulate basic phone functionality 
- add method called MakeCall() that reduces battery by 5%
- if battery is below 5% print "Low battery, please charge"
### 4. Create class for new object
- object of own choosing, maybe enemy stats?
### 5. Encapsulation: getters and setters
- create getter and setter for serial number to enforce encapsulation
### 6. Manipulating an array of objects
- create array of phone objects and write a loop to print phone information for each phone.
